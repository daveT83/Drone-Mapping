# Drone-Mapping
This software takes x amount of data points collected by some mapping tool (in this case a drone). 
All points are read in from a .xyz file in the following format:
</br></br>
1.1,1.1,0.3
</br>
1.1,1.5,0.6
</br>
i.e. x-coordinate, y-coordinate, z-coordinate
</br>

Once fed the appropriate file(s) this software will be able process all of the points and order them into a matrix. 
This matrix will then bew used to analyze and compare the data later, as well as, used to create a 3D map, a 2D map or both
using MatLab. This will allow for the user to visually compare multiple data sets and for the software to perform a more accurate 
analysis of the data.
</br></br>
Above includes sample data that I collected for this project. This may allow for you to see how this software is supposed to function.
Above I have the README.txt that will better explain how to properly run this software.

<b>*Note to reduce download size don't download my sample data it is several GBs in size. All supplemental .xyz and .txt files are located on my google drive because they were too large to upload here. Link below.<b>
